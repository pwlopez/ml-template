    /opt/ml/model â€“ Your algorithm should write all final model artifacts to this directory. SageMaker 
    copies this data as a single object in compressed tar format to the S3 location that you specified 
    in the CreateTrainingJob request. If multiple containers in a single training job write to this 
    directory they should ensure no file/directory names clash. SageMaker aggregates the result in a 
    TAR file and uploads to S3 at the end of the training job.
